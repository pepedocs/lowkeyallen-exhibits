First Computer Bug - Grace Hopper's Moth

# what
The first recorded computer "bug" - literally a moth trapped in Harvard's Mark II computer, found by Grace Hopper's team. This event gave us the term "debugging" and represented the intersection of physical hardware failures and software problems.

# impact
- Popularized the terms "bug" and "debugging" in computing
- Demonstrated the importance of systematic problem documentation
- Highlighted the reliability challenges of early electronic systems
- Established Grace Hopper as a pioneering figure in computer science
- Created one of computing's most enduring origin stories

# expertExplanation
Grace Hopper didn't coin the term "bug" (Thomas Edison used it decades earlier), but she and her team documented the first literal computer bug. The Mark II was an electromechanical computer using thousands of mechanical relays. When one relay failed to close properly, the team investigated and found a moth trapped inside. Hopper's meticulous documentation of this incident, including taping the actual moth to the logbook, created computing folklore while demonstrating the systematic approach to problem-solving that would become standard in software engineering.

# expertExplanation
This version predates the famous K&R book version and represents one of the earliest documented "Hello, World!" programs. Written during the birth of Unix at Bell Labs, this code embodies the Unix philosophy of simplicity and clarity. Notice the older C syntax with spaces in "main( )" and the absence of the newline character. This program was likely used to test the early C compiler and demonstrate basic I/O functionality. The fact that such a simple program became the foundation for teaching programming speaks to the genius of its creators in recognizing that complex systems are built from simple, understandable parts.

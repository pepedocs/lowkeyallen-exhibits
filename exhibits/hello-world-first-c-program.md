# expertExplanation
This simple program from Kernighan and Ritchie's "The C Programming Language" book became the de facto standard for demonstrating basic syntax in programming languages. Its elegance lies in its simplicity - just enough code to show input/output and program structure. The choice of "hello, world" as the message was informal and friendly, setting a welcoming tone for new programmers. This 6-line program has been adapted to virtually every programming language since 1978, making it arguably the most reproduced piece of code in history.

# Hello World - The First Program (1972)

## What
The first "Hello, World!" program, created by Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs in 1972. This simple program became the traditional first step for every programmer learning a new language.

## When
1972

## Where
Bell Labs, Murray Hill, New Jersey

## Language
C

## Category
Historical

## Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

## Source
Original example from "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie

## Why This Matters
This seemingly simple program revolutionized how programming was taught. Before "Hello, World!", introductory programs were often complex mathematical calculations. Kernighan's choice of a friendly greeting made programming more approachable and human.

## Expert Explanation
"Hello, World!" established the tradition that a programmer's first program should do something simple but meaningful - communicate with the human user. This 11-word program has been rewritten in virtually every programming language ever created, making it perhaps the most reproduced piece of code in history. It represents the moment when programming shifted from pure computation to human-computer interaction.

## The Impact
- Became the universal first program for learning any programming language
- Made programming education more accessible and less intimidating
- Established the tradition of simple, friendly introductory examples
- Has been implemented in over 500 programming languages

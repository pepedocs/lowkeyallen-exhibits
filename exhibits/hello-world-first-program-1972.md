# expertExplanation
"Hello, World!" established the tradition that a programmer's first program should do something simple but meaningful - communicate with the human user. This 11-word program has been rewritten in virtually every programming language ever created, making it perhaps the most reproduced piece of code in history. It represents the moment when programming shifted from pure computation to human-computer interaction.

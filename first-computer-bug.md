# expertExplanation
While Grace Hopper didn't coin the term "bug" (it was used earlier), she did find an actual moth trapped in Relay 70, Panel F of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947. Her team taped the moth into their logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found." This incident helped popularize "debugging" as the term for fixing computer problems.
